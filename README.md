# The Guide to Basic Mathematical Concepts

We believe that mathematics is a powerful language that everyday people can
use to express and communicate ideas with far greater precision than can be
attained with natural language alone.

This project seeks to provide a guide to basic mathematical concepts,
definitions, and notation that is:

- Freely available under a Creative Commons license
- Accessible to non-experts
- Concise

## Accessing the Guide

**TODO**: Once the guide is published on the internet, links will be added
here.

## Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is limited and focused. The goal is to document
basic mathematical concepts, definitions, and notation such as sets, tuples,
functions, and numbers. Theorems will generally not be provided unless they
are fundamental to the concept. Proofs will not be developed. Explanations
and examples will be kept brief.

This project is limited to the English language. Others may want to translate
the guide into other languages and we fully encourage that. However, such
initiatives should be managed under separate projects.
